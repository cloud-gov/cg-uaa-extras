        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>
            admin has invited you to join the
            closed pilot of
            <a href="https://cloud.gov">{{branding.company_name}}</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            {{branding.company_name}} is a new service under
            development by 18F intended to help
            federal teams focus on creating quality services securely hosted in the cloud,
            and assist in getting Authority to Operate (ATO) in record time.
            {{branding.company_name}} is currently in
            <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard/">alpha state</a>
            and under active development. We'll be asking for your feedback and making
            improvements on a regular basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            To this point, {{branding.company_name}} has been an
            internal-facing service for 18F,
            so please have patience as we improve the on-boarding and support experience
            for people from other agencies, and correct documentation which may be
            18F-specific.
        </p>

        </p>
        <strong>Here's what happens next</strong>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                In order to perform multi-factor authentication with the cloud.gov provider,
                you will need an authentication application that generates time-based on-time
                passwords.  We recommend either
                <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en">Google Authenticator</a> or <a href="https://www.authy.com/app/mobile">Authy</a>. Download the app on your mobile device, you will be presented instructions
                during the registration process on how to store the cloud.gov key in your application.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="{{invite.inviteLink}}">Accept Invite</a>
                to continue the registration process.
            </li>
            <li>
                You should download the CLI tool to start using the platform according to
                the <a href="https://docs.cloud.gov/getting-started/setup/">Getting Started - Setup</a> page.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you log in immediately, you may not see any orgs or spaces to which
                you have access. It might take up to 5 minutes to provision your sandbox
                space.
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            That's it! You're ready to use the platform. The platform is well-documented
            at <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org">https://docs.cloudfoundry.org</a>,
            and documentation about {{branding.company_name}} in particular is
            located <a href="https://docs.cloud.gov">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll probably want to try deploying an application to see how it works.
            We have some sample applications available
            <a href="https://github.com/18F/cf-hello-worlds">here</a>.
